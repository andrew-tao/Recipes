# Recipes
A small demo app that allows users to search for, save, edit, and create recipes.
Implements debounced searching using an API call to [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com).
Significant inspiration and help drawn from the [Apple Developer Scrumdinger iOS App Dev Tutorial.](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger)
